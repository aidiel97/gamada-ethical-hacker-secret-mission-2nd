#Ethical Hacking – Fun Assignment

This repository contains a playful end-of-session assignment for students learning Ethical Hacking (Week 3: Scanning Networks).
Instead of technical tasks, students are given a light-hearted “mission”: unlock a secret message with a static password.

#🎯 Purpose

To close the session with a fun and relaxing activity.

To remind students that rest is also important in the middle of busy learning.

To give a simple taste of basic web password-gate logic.

#📖 How it Works

Open the GitHub Pages link of this repo.

Enter the static password.

The hidden message and motivational quote will be revealed.

#⚠️ Note

This repository is purely for educational and fun purposes.
There is no real hacking involved here — it’s just a small web exercise with a positive message.

👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 For Students

Congratulations on completing Technique #3 of Ethical Hacking (Scanning Networks)!
